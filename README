Omega -- Operations on Presburger arithmetic formulae

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

This is a Cabal package.  The typical build process is:

	runhaskell Setup.hs configure
	runhaskell Setup.hs build
	runhaskell Setup.hs install

This package requires the C++ Omega library to be installed
(http://github.com/davewathaverford/the-omega-project).  Because this package
contains C++ source code, Cabal will probably need help finding the required
headers and libraries.

You will probably need to provide the paths to the C++ include directory
(contains STL headers such as "vector") and library directory (contains the
C runtime library, called "libstdc++.so" on GNU Linux systems).  If the C++
Omega library is not installed in a standard place, you will also need to
provide paths to it.

A configuration might look something like this:

	runhaskell Setup.hs configure \
		--extra-include-dirs=$(YOUR_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH) \
		--extra-lib-dirs=$(YOUR_CXX_LIB_PATH) \
		--extra-include-dirs=$(YOUR_OMEGA_PATH)/basic/include \
		--extra-include-dirs=$(YOUR_OMEGA_PATH)/omega_lib/include \
		--extra-lib-dirs=$(YOUR_OMEGA_PATH)/omega_lib/obj
